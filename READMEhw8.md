## HW 8
### Features we were able to get working for HW8:
* The red player's view (our GUI from the previous assignments) is fully functional
* The blue player's view (provider's view) visualizes the board
* The user is able to pass in the blue player's view
* Game over message displays properly when both players pass

### What's not working:
* We were unable to render cards for the blue player due to a casting error, as described in our
  PeerReview.txt starting on line 29
* Because of this, the blue player is unable to place cards and thus cannot make moves besides
  passing

### Changing files:
* Our customers did not request that we change any of our code, so the files weren't changed from
  our homework 7 submission
